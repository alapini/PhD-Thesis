The complexity of algebraic algorithms is often more easily described
in a non-Turing model where one assumes that any algebraic operation
can be done in a unit of time and any other operation is
free. \emph{Algebraic complexity} studies precisely the computational
models that behave this way.

For algorithms over finite rings, the algebraic complexity gives a
precise estimate for the complexity in the Turing model (also called
the \emph{binary complexity}). For other rings, the algebraic estimate
may be way off target, but it can nevertheless give useful information.

In this chapter we study models that allow one to study the algebraic
complexity of linear operators. We first present the \emph{arithmetic
  circuit}, then the \emph{straight line program}. Because of their
algebraic structure, these models support some algebraic
manipulations.  Our principal interest will be the \emph{transposition
  theorem}, stating that it is possible to apply classical duality (in
the sense of Section~\ref{sec:linear-algebra:duality}) to programs,
while preserving some complexity invariants. The interest for the
transposition theorem comes from the applications we have seen in
Section~\ref{sec:transp-algor} and other more advanced applications
that we will see in the next chapters.

Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:word-about-automatic}, we study the
relationship between the transposition theorem and the classical
theory of \emph{automatic differentiation}.
