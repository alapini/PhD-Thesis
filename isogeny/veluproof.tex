\chapter{Proof of Vélu's formulas}
\label{cha:proof-velus-formulas}

I always had admiration for my colleagues who can develop by hand two
pages full of computations without making mistakes. Concerning me, I
usually make a sign mistake at the third term. Tired of having to
check for sign errors in other people's papers any time I had to use
Vélu formulas, I decided to make an automatic proof of it.

The following Magma code proves the passage from Eq.~\eqref{eq:155} to
Eq.~\eqref{eq:161} and from there to~\eqref{eq:157}.

The first and second line of output are the differences between each
term of the sums in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:155} and~\eqref{eq:161}. In both
lines, to conclude one must observe that all the terms in the
difference contain an odd power of $y(Q)$, thus they sum up to $0$
over $G^\ast$.

The third line is the difference between each term of the sums in
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:161} and~\eqref{eq:157}. The result is
self-explanatory.
