\subsection{Building the tower}

This subsection introduces the basic algorithms required to build the
primitive tower of Theorem~\ref{th:cantor}, that is, compute the
required minimal polynomials $Q_i$.

\paragraph{Composition.} We give first an algorithm for sparse
polynomial composition, to be used in the construction of the tower
defined before.  Given $P$ and $R$ in $\F_p[X]$, we want to compute
$P(R)$. For the cost analysis, it will be useful later on to consider
both the degree $k$ and the number of terms $\ell$ of $R$.

\alg{Compose} is a recursive process that cuts $P$ into $c+1$
``slices'' of degree less than $p^n$, recursively composes them with
$R$, and concludes using Horner's scheme and the linearity of the
$p$-power. At the leaves of the recursion tree, we use the following naive
algorithm.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{NaiveCompose}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $P,R\in\F_p[X]$.
    \ENSURE $P(R)$.
    \STATE write $P=\sum_{i=0}^{\deg(P)} p_i X^{i}$, with $p_i \in \F_p$;
    \STATE let $S=0$, $\rho=1$;
    \STATE for $i\in [0,\dots,\deg(P)]$, let $S=S+p_i \rho$ and $\rho =\rho R$;
    \STATE return $S$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{lemma}
  \alg{NaiveCompose} has cost $O(\deg(P)^2k\ell)$.  
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} At step $i$, $\rho$ and $S$ have degree at most
$ik$. Computing the sum $S + p_i \rho$ takes time $O(ik)$ and
computing the product $\rho R$ takes time $O(ik\ell)$, since $R$ has
$\ell$ terms. The total cost of step $i$ is thus $O(ik\ell)$, 
whence a total cost of $O(\deg(P)^2 k\ell)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Compose}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $P,R\in\F_p[X]$.
    \ENSURE $P(R)$.
    \STATE\label{c:params} let $n=\lfloor \log_p(\deg(P)) \rfloor$ and $c=\deg(P) {\sf~div~} p^n$;
    \STATE If $n=0$, return $\alg{NaiveCompose}(P,R)$;
    \STATE write $P=\sum_{i=0}^{c} P_i X^{ip^n}$, with $P_i \in \F_p[X], \deg P_i<p^n$;
    \STATE for $i\in [0,\dots,c]$, let $Q_i = \text{\alg{Compose}}(P_i,R)$;
    \STATE let $Q=0$;
    \STATE\label{c:loop} for $i\in [c,\dots,0]$, let $Q = Q R(X^{p^n})  + Q_i$;
    \STATE return $Q$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\begin{theorem}
  \label{theo:comp}
  If $R$ has degree $k$ and $\ell$ non-zero coefficients and if
  $\deg(P)=s$, then \alg{Compose}$(P,R)$ outputs $P(R)$ in time $O(ps
  \log_p(s)k\ell)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Correctness is clear, since $R^{p^n}=R(X^{p^n})$. To analyze the
  cost, we let $\sC(c,n)$ be the cost of {\alg{Compose}} when
  $\deg(P)\le (c+1)p^n$, with $c<p$. Then $\sC(c,0) \in O(c^2k\ell)$.
  For $n > 0$, at each pass in the loop at step~\ref{c:loop}, $\deg(Q)
  < cp^n k$, so that the multiplication (using the naive algorithm)
  and addition take time $O(cp^nk\ell)$. Thus the time spent in the
  loop is $O(c^2p^{n}k\ell)$, and the running time
  satisfies
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:70}
    \sC(c,n) \le (c+1)\sC(p-1,n-1) + O(c^2p^nk\ell)
    \text{.}    
  \end{equation}
  Let then $\sC'(n)=\sC(p-1,n)$, so that we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:71}
    \sC'(0) \in O(p^2k\ell), \quad \sC'(n) \le p\sC'(n-1) +
    O(p^{n+2}k\ell)
    \text{.}  
  \end{equation}
  We deduce that $\sC'(n) \in O(p^{n+2}nk\ell)$,
  and finally
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:72}
    \sC(c,n) \in O(cp^{n+1}nk\ell + c^2p^nk\ell)
    \text{.}  
  \end{equation}
  The values $c,n$ computed at step~\ref{c:params} of the top-level
  call to \alg{Compose} satisfy $cp^n\le s$ and $n\le\log_p (s)$; this
  gives our conclusion.
\end{proof}

\begin{nota}
  A binary divide-and-conquer algorithm~\cite[Exercise~9.20]{vzGG} has
  cost 
  \[O(\Mult(sk)\log(s))\text{.}\] Our algorithm has a slightly better
  dependency on $s$, but adds a polynomial cost in $p$ and
  $\ell$. However, we have in mind cases with $p$ small and $\ell=2$,
  where the latter solution is advantageous.
\end{nota}

\paragraph{Computing the minimal polynomials.}
Theorem~\ref{th:cantor} shows that we have defined a primitive
tower. To be able to work with it, we explain now how to compute the
minimal polynomial $Q_i$ of $x_i$ over $\F_p$. This is done by
extending Cantor's construction~\cite{cantor89}, which had $\U_0=\F_p$.

For $i=0$, we are given $Q_0\in\F_p[X_0]$ such that
$\U_0=\F_p[X_0]/Q_0(X_0)$, so there is nothing to do; we assume that
$\Tr_{\U_0/\F_p}(x_0)\ne0$ to meet the hypotheses of
Theorem~\ref{th:cantor}. 

\begin{remark}
  If $\Tr_{\U_0/\F_p}(x_0)=0$, assuming $\gcd(d,p)=1$, we can replace
  $Q_0$ by $Q_0(X_0-1)$; this is done by taking $R=X_0-1$ in algorithm
  \alg{Compose}, so by Theorem~\ref{theo:comp} the cost is $O(pd
  \log_p(d))$.

  So, the only case we cannot handle is when $p$ divides $d$ and the
  trace of $x_0$ is zero. By Lemma~\ref{th:multi-newton-sums}, this
  happens if and only if the $(d-1)$-th coefficient of $Q$ is equal to
  $0$. Heuristically, if the polynomial $Q$ is chosen at random, this
  happens with probability $1/q$.
\end{remark}

For $i=1$, we know that $x_1^p-x_1=x_0$, so $x_1$ is a root of
$Q_0(X_1^p-X_1)$. Since $Q_0(X_1^p-X_1)$ is monic of degree $pd$, we
deduce that $Q_1=Q_0(X_1^p-X_1)$. To compute it, we use algorithm
\alg{Compose} with arguments $Q_0$ and $R=X_1^p-X_1$; the cost is
$O(p^2d \log_p(d))$ by Theorem~\ref{theo:comp}. The same arguments
hold for $i=2$ when $p=2$ and $d$ is odd.

To deal with other indexes $i$, we follow Cantor's construction.  Let
$\Cyclo\in \F_p[X]$ be the reduction modulo $p$ of the $(2p-1)$-th
cyclotomic polynomial. Cantor implicitly works modulo an irreducible
factor of $\Cyclo$. The following shows that we can avoid
factorization, by working modulo $\Cyclo$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:poly-cyclic}
  Let $\algeb{A}=\F_p[X]/\Cyclo$ and let $x = X \bmod \Cyclo$. For
  $Q\in\F_p[Y]$, define 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:73}
    Q^\star = \prod_{i=0}^{2p-2}Q(x^iY)
    \text{.}    
  \end{equation}
  Then $Q^\star$ is in $\F_p[Y]$ and there exists $q^\star\in\F_p[Y]$
  such that $Q^\star = q^\star(Y^{2p-1})$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $F_1,\dots,F_e$ be the irreducible factors of $\Cyclo$ and let
  $f$ be their common degree. To prove that $Q^\star$ is in $\F_p[Y]$,
  we prove that for $j \le e$, 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:74}
    Q^\star_j = Q^\star \bmod F_j    
  \end{equation}
  is in $\F_p[Y]$ and independent from $j$; the claim follows by
  Chinese Remaindering.

  For $j \le e$, let $a_j$ be a root of $F_j$ in the algebraic closure
  of $\F_p$, so that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:75}
    Q^\star_j = \prod_{i=0}^{2p-2}Q(a_j^iY)
    \text{.}
  \end{equation}
  Since $\gcd(p^f,2p-1)=1$, $Q^\star_j$ is invariant under ${\rm
    Gal}(\F_{p^f}/\F_p)$, and thus in $\F_p[Y]$. Besides, for $j,j'\le
  e$, $a_j = a_{j'}^k$, for some $k$ coprime to $2p-1$, so that
  $Q^\star_j= Q^\star_{j'}$, as needed.

  To conclude, note that for $j \le e$,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:76}
    Q^\star_j(a_jY)=Q^\star_j(Y)
    \text{,}    
  \end{equation}
  so that all coefficients of degree not a multiple of $2p-1$ are
  zero.  Thus, $Q^\star_j$ has the form $q^\star_j(Y^{2p-1})$; by
  Chinese Remaindering, this proves the existence of the polynomial
  $q^\star$.
%% 12-02 %% I think you're messing up indices. You meant
%%%%%%%%%%% $i = \euler(2p-1)/e$ and $j<i$, I believe.
%% 12-31 %% Yup.
\end{proof}


We conclude as in~\cite{cantor89}: supposing that we know the minimal
polynomial $Q_i$ of $x_i$ over $\F_p$, we compute $Q_{i+1}$ using the
following algorithm.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{MinimalPolynomial}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $Q_i$, $\Phi$.
    \ENSURE $Q_{i+1}$.
    \STATE \label{alg:minpol-Qstar}$Q^\star = \prod_{i=0}^{2p-2}Q(x^iY) \bmod \Phi$;
    \STATE \label{alg:minpol-qstar}$q^\star(Y^{2p-1}) = Q^\star(Y)$;
    \STATE \label{alg:minpol-Q}$Q_{i+1} = \alg{Compose}(q^\star,Y^p-Y)$.
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\begin{theorem}
  Algorithm \alg{MinimalPolynomial} is correct and computes its output
  in time
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:77}
    O( p^{i+2}d\log_p(p^id)+\Mult(p^{i+2}d)\log(p))
    \text{.}    
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $x_i$ is a root of $Q_i$, it is a root of $Q_i^\star$ too. So
  $\gamma_i=x_i^{2p-1}$ is a root of $q_i^\star$ and $x_{i+1}$ is a
  root of $q_i^\star(Y^p-Y)$. Since the latter polynomial is monic of
  degree $p^{i+1}d$, it is the minimal polynomial $Q_{i+1}$ of
  $x_{i+1}$ over $\F_p$.

  As for the complexity, the algorithm of~\cite{brent93} computes
  $\Cyclo$ in time $O(p^2)$; then, polynomial multiplications of
  degree $s$ in $\algeb{A}[Y]$ can be done in time $O(\Mult(sp))$ by
  Kronecker substitution. The overall cost of
  step~\ref{alg:minpol-Qstar} is $O(\Mult(p^{i+2}d)\log p)$ using a
  subproduct tree (see
  Section~\ref{sec:fund-algor}). Step~\ref{alg:minpol-qstar} is free
  and step~\ref{alg:minpol-Q} costs $O(p^{i+2}d\log_p(p^id))$.
\end{proof}

The former cost is linear in $p^{i+2}d$, up to logarithmic factors,
for an input of size $p^id$ and an output of size $p^{i+1}d$.

Some further operations will be performed when we construct the tower:
we will precompute quantities that will be of use in the algorithms of
the next sections. Details are given in the next sections, when
needed.
