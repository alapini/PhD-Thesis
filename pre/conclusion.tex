\chapter{Conclusion}

\pdfmctwo{Conclusion.}
We have presented our contributions to the study of efficient
algorithms for towers of finite fields and isogenies between elliptic
curves. In view of these applications, we have employed advanced
algebraic and algorithmic techniques, and developed new tools that
have an interest of their own. Our contributions span three directions.

\paragraph{Transposition principle}
\pdfmcthree{Kaltofen did not like this sentence.}  Before this work,
the transposition principle used to be considered difficult to apply,
and transposed algorithms were notoriously difficult to interpret and
implement correctly.  Following~\cite{bostan+lecerf+schost:tellegen},
one could apply the principle in an automatic fashion to a very
special class of algebraic algorithms, that we call \emph{algebraic
  transforms} in Section~\ref{sec:stra-line-progr}. More general
algebraic algorithms, such as polynomial multiplication or Euclidean
division, were still treated case-by-case.

In this document we have shown that typed functional languages allow
to automatically infer the linear algebraic structure of any algebraic
algorithm. Once this structure is known, the transposition of the
algebraic algorithm is automatically produced by partial evaluation.
It would be interesting to explore new ways of implementing the
transposition principle in higher order languages such as Haskell, Coq
or Agda, as this could have applications to the formal verification of
computer algebra systems by automated theorem provers.  We have
sketched some relevant ideas in Appendix~\ref{cha:basic-categ-theory}.

\paragraph{Towers of finite fields}
With the help of transposed algorithms, we have constructed a family
of Artin-Schreier towers of finite fields with quasi-optimal
arithmetic operations. Thanks to Couveignes'
algorithm~\cite{couveignes00}, such fast arithmetic generalize to any
Artin-Schreier tower.

Since any separable extension of degree equal to the characteristic is
Artin-Schreier, our construction provides --at least in theory-- fast
arithmetics for any such tower of extensions.  This can be applied,
for example, to the computation of torsion points of Abelian
varieties, as we did in this document. It would be interesting to
generalize this construction to the case of function fields, as this
could have applications to coding
theory~\cite{garcia+stichtenoth96,shum-et-al01}.

\paragraph{Elliptic curves}
Using our construction for Artin-Schreier towers, we were able to give
the first complete implementation of Couveignes' second algorithm for
isogeny computation~\cite{couveignes96}. This, together with a further
improvement we have presented in Section~\ref{sec:C2-AS-FI}, yields an
algorithm whose complexity is quadratic in the degree of the isogeny.

The comparison of our implementation with Lercier and Sirvent's
algorithm \cite{lercier+sirvent08} concludes in favor of the latter,
however our improvements to Couveignes' algorithm stay of theoretical
interest for several reasons. First, Couveignes' algorithm can be
easily generalized to Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves, although with
a much worse complexity. Improving such generalization, at least for
the case of genus $2$ hyperelliptic curves, would be of some relevance
for point counting~\cite{schoof95,pila90,gaudry+schost04}; although
$p$-adic methods are likely to remain the best algorithms for the
small characteristic case~\cite{kedlaya01,denef+vercauteren06}.

Second, our generalization of Couveignes' algorithm to compute
isogenies of unknown degree sheds new light on Couveignes' algorithm
and on the complexity of the isogeny computation problem; and could
have applications in
cryptography~\cite{teske06,rostovtsev+stolbunov06}.  Looking for
similar generalizations of other algorithms, such as Couveignes' first
algorithm~\cite{couveignes94}, is a first step towards a better
understanding of the problem, and could ultimately lead to an optimal
algorithm to compute isogenies of given degree between elliptic
curves: a result that is still out of reach today.
