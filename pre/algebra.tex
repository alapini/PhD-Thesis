constitute the background for all the chapters that follow. To the
reader interested in reading more about these topics, we recommend

fields and \cite{silverman:elliptic,silverman:advanced} for elliptic
curves.

\section{Groups, Rings, Fields}
\label{sec:ring-fields}

\subsection{Objects}
\label{sec:ring-fields:objects}

\subsubsection{Groups}

A \index{group}\textbf{group} is a pair $(G,\cdot)$ such that $G$ is a
set and $\cdot:G\times G\ra G$ is an \emph{internal composition law}
satisfying:
\begin{itemize}
\item \index{associativity}\textbf{Associativity}: $(a\cdot b)\cdot c
  = a \cdot (b\cdot c)$ for any $a,b\in G$;
\item There is an element $e\in G$, called the
  \index{identity~element}\textbf{identity}, such that $a\cdot e =
  e\cdot a = a$ for any $a\in G$;
\item For any $a\in G$ there is an
  \index{inverse~element}\textbf{inverse element} $a^{-1}$ such that
  $a\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1}\cdot a = e$.
\end{itemize}
If $\cdot$ also satisfies $a\cdot b=b\cdot a$
(\index{commutativity}\textbf{commutativity}), the group is said to be
\index{group!abelian}\textbf{abelian}. The group composed of one
single element with the obvious law is called the
\index{group!trivial}\textbf{trivial group}.

A \index{subgroup}\textbf{subgroup} of a group $(G,\cdot)$ is a group
$(H,\circ)$ such that $H\subset G$ and $\circ$ is the restriction of
$\cdot$ to $H$. Any group has two trivial subgroups: the trivial group
and itself. The \index{opposite!group}
\index{group!opposite~group}opposite group of a group $(G,\cdot)$ is
the group $(G,\cdot^\op)$ where $a\cdot^\op b=b\cdot a$ for any
$a,b\in G$.

The \index{center!of~a~group} \index{group!center}\textbf{center} of
$(G,\cdot)$ is the subgroup formed by the elements $a\in G$ such that
$a\cdot b=b\cdot a$ for any $a\in G$. The center is clearly a
commutative group.

Let $A$ be a subset of $G$, the group
\index{group!generator}\index{generator!of~a~group}\textbf{generated}
by $A$, denoted by $\langle A\rangle$, is the smallest subgroup of
$(G,\cdot)$ containing $A$. A finite group generated by a single
element is said to be
\index{cyclic!group}\index{group!cyclic}\textbf{cyclic}.

Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group, $(H,\cdot)$ a subgroup and $g\in G$. The
subset $g\cdot H = \{g\cdot h | h \in H \}$ of $G$ is called a
\index{coset!left~coset}\textbf{left coset} of $H$, or simply
\index{coset}coset. A \index{coset!right~coset}\textbf{right coset},
denoted by $H\cdot g$, is a left coset for the opposite group; when
$G$ is abelian the two notions coincide. A subgroup $H$ is called
\index{subgroup!normal}normal if $g\cdot H=H\cdot g$ for any $g\in G$;
note that if $G$ is abelian, any subgroup is normal. Let $H$ be
normal, the cosets of $H$ form a group under the law $(g\cdot
H,g'\cdot H)\mapsto (g\cdot g')\cdot H$, this group is called the
\index{quotient!of~groups}\textbf{quotient} of $G$ by $H$ and is
denoted by $G/H$.

Let $S$ be a set and let $G$ be a group. A
\index{group~action!left~group~action}
\index{group~action}\textbf{(left) group action} of $G$ over $S$ is a
law $.:G\times S\ra S$ such that for any $g,g'\in G$ and $x\in S$,
\begin{itemize}
\item $g'.(g.x) = (g'\cdot g). x$,
\item $e. x = x$.
\end{itemize}
A \index{group~action!right~group~action}\textbf{right group action}
is a left group action for the opposite group.


\subsubsection{Rings, Fields}

A \index{ring}\textbf{ring} is a tuple $(R,+,\cdot)$ such that $(R,+)$
is an abelian group and $\cdot:R\times R\ra R$ is an internal
composition law satisfying associativity, existence of the identity
and \index{distributivity}\textbf{distributivity} over $+$
\[a \cdot (b + c) = (a\cdot b) + (a\cdot c) \quad\text{for any
  $a,b,c\in R$.}\] When $\cdot$ satisfies commutativity, the ring is
said to be \index{ring!commutative}\textbf{commutative}.  The law $+$
is called \emph{addition}, $\cdot$ is called \emph{multiplication},
the identity for $+$ is denoted by $0$ and the identity for $\cdot$ by
$1$.  A commutative ring such that $1\ne 0$ and where $\cdot$ also
satisfies the existence of the inverse, is called a
\index{field}\textbf{field}.

A \index{subring}\textbf{subring} of a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ is a ring
$(S,\ast,\circ)$ such that $(S,\ast)$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$ and
$\circ$ is the restriction of $\cdot$ to $S$.  The
\index{opposite!ring}\index{ring!opposite~ring}\textbf{opposite ring}
of a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ is the ring $(R,+,\cdot^\op)$
where $a\cdot^\op b=b\cdot a$ for any $a,b\in R$.

The simplest example of ring is $\Z$, the set of integers; the
rational numbers $\Q$ are an example of field, it is the
\emph{smallest} field containing $\Z$ as a subring. The
\index{ring!trivial}\textbf{trivial ring} is the ring composed of one
unique element $r=0=1$ with the evident laws; note that by definition
this is not a field.

\subsubsection{Modules, ideals, vector spaces}

Given a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ a \index{module!left~module}\textbf{left
  module}, or simply \textbf{module}, over $R$ is a tuple $(M, +_M,
\cdot_M)$ such that $(M,+_M)$ is an abelian group and $\cdot_M:R\times
M\ra M$ is an \emph{external law} such that for any $r,r'\in R$ and
$m,m'\in R$
\begin{itemize}
\item $(r + r')\cdot_M m = (r \cdot_M m) +_M (r'\cdot_M m)$,
\item $r\cdot_M(m +_M m') = (r\cdot_M m) +_M (r'\cdot_M m)$,
\item $r'\cdot_M(r\cdot_M m ) = (r'r)\cdot_M m$,
\item $1\cdot_M m = m$.
\end{itemize}
The law $+_M$ is called \emph{addition}, its identity is denoted by
$0$; the law $\cdot_M$ is called
\index{multiplication!scalar}\index{scalar~multiplication}\textbf{scalar}
or
\index{mutliplication!external}\index{external~multiplication}\textbf{external}
multiplication.

A \index{module!right~module}\textbf{right module} is a left module
for the opposite ring $R^\op$, a
\index{module!two-sided}\textbf{two-sided module} also called
\index{bimodule}\textbf{bimodule} is an object that is both a left and
a right module. When $R$ is commutative, the three notions coincide
and we simply speak of a \index{module}\textbf{module}.  $R$-module is
another way of saying ``module over $R$''. When $\K$ is a field, a
$\K$-module is called a \index{vector~space}\textbf{$\K$-vector
  space}.

A \index{module!submodule}\index{submodule!left~submodule}left
(\index{submoudle!right~submodule}right,
\index{submodule!two-sided}two-sided) \textbf{submodule} of a left
(right, two-sided) $R$-module $(M,+,\cdot)$ is a left (right, two-sided)
$R$-module $(N,\ast,\circ)$ such that $(N,\ast)$ is a subgroup of
$(M,+)$ and $\circ$ is the restriction of $\cdot$ to $R\times N$.

The module containing one unique element with the evident laws is
called the \index{module!zero~module}\textbf{zero module}; any
$R$-module contains a submodule that is isomorphic to the zero
module. Any group $(G,+)$ can be given a $\Z$-module structure by the
law
\[n\cdot g = \underbrace{g + \cdots + g}_{n\text{ times}} \text{.}\]
Any ring $R$ is trivially a two-sided module over itself; a
\index{ideal!left~ideal} (\index{ideal!right~ideal}right,
\index{ideal!two-sided}two-sided) \textbf{ideal} of a ring $R$ is a
submodule of the left (right, two-sided) $R$-module $R$.  When $R$ is
commutative one simply speaks of an \index{ideal}ideal.  

Any ring contains at least two submodules: the zero module and itself;
these are called the \index{ideal!trivial}\textbf{trivial ideals}. The
only non-trivial ideals of $\Z$ are the $n\Z$ for any $n\ne0,1$. A
field has no non-trivial ideals.

The \index{direct~sum}\textbf{direct sum} $M\oplus N$ of two
$R$-modules $(M,+_M,\cdot_M)$ and $(N,+_N,\cdot_N)$ is the module
$(M\times N,+,\cdot)$ where the laws $+$ and $\cdot$ are defined
component-wise. This generalizes to sums of an arbitrary number of
modules: let $(M_i)_{i\in I}$ be a sequence of $R$-modules, the direct
sum $\bigoplus_{i\in I}M_i$ is the $R$-module whose elements are the
sequences $(m_1,m_2,\ldots)$ where $m_i\in M_i$ and $m_i=0$ for all
but a finite number of them; the laws are defined component-wise.
Although less commonly used, there also exists a notion of
\index{direct~product}\textbf{direct product}: given $(M_i)_{i\in I}$,
the direct product $\prod_{i\in I}M_i$ is the $R$-module whose
elements are the sequences $(m_1,m_2,\ldots)$ where $m_i\in M_i$ with
the laws defined component-wise. Clearly, the two definition coincide
when $I$ is a finite set.

When $R$ is seen as an $R$-module over itself, we denote by $R^n$ the
direct sum $\bigoplus_{0<i\le n}R$ and by $R^\infty$ the direct sum
$\bigoplus_{i>0}R$. An $R$-module that is isomorphic to the direct sum
$\bigoplus_{I}R$ for some $I$ is called a
\index{module!free}\textbf{free module}. A \index{basis}\textbf{basis}
of a module $M$ is a family $(m_i)_{i\in I}$ of elements of $M$ such
that any $m\in M$ can be written as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:module-basis}
  m = \sum_{i\in I} r_i\circ m_i
  \quad\text{with $r_i\in R$}
\end{equation}
in an unique way. Clearly, if we note by $e_i$ the element of
$\bigoplus_IR$ that has $1$ in the $i$-th position and $0$ elsewhere,
the family $(e_i)_{i\in I}$ forms a basis; hence, any free module has
a basis and, conversely, any module that has a basis is free. One
important statement about bases of modules is the following.

\begin{proposition}
  Any two bases for a free module $M$ over a commutative ring $R$ have
  the same cardinality.
\end{proposition}

For this reason, when $M$ is a free module over a commutative ring $R$
we call \index{dimension} \index{module!free!dimension~of}
\index{vector~space!dimension~of}\textbf{dimension} the cardinality of
any of its bases. It is a well known result in linear algebra that any
vector space has a basis, hence any $\K$-vector space is free as a
$\K$-module.

Given a module $M$ and a submodule $N$, the quotient group $M/N$ can
be given a module structure by the law $r\cdot(m+N)=(r\cdot m)+N$, it
is then called the \index{quotient!of~modules}\textbf{quotient
  module}. When $R$ is a ring and $I$ a module, the quotient $R/I$ can
also be given a ring structure by the law $(r+I)\cdot(r'+I)=(r\cdot
r')+I$, it is then called the \index{quotient!of~ring}\textbf{quotient
  ring}.
